How to use this code:

(1) prepare your medical dataset and divide the dataset to two subset: labeled set and unlabel set

(2) edit the customised train data path in train.py and then run train.py to train model

(3) edit the customised test data path in test.py and then run test.py to test model

a more optimized version will be released soon.
